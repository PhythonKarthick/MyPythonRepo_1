## Write a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (inclusive of high and low)

def ran_check(num,low,high):
    if num in range(low,high+1):
        print('{} is in range {} and {}'.format(num,low,high))
    else:
        print('{} is not in range {} and {}'.format(num,low,high))

## If you only wanted to return a boolean:

def ran_bool(num,low,high):
    return low<=num<=high
